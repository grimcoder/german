### Day 7: Review, Practice & Evaluation

#### Review Activities
1. **Grammar Review**: Go through the key grammar points from each day, especially focusing on areas where you feel less confident.
2. **Vocabulary Recap**: Revisit the vocabulary lists. Try to create sentences using as many new words as possible.
3. **Listening and Speaking Practice**: If possible, find German language videos or audio clips to listen to. Try to understand the content and practice speaking along with the audio.

#### Practice Exercises
1. **Translation Practice**: Translate a short paragraph from English to German, incorporating vocabulary and grammar structures from the week.
2. **Dialogue Creation**: Write a dialogue in German, simulating a real-life scenario (e.g., a job interview, a business meeting, making a reservation).
3. **Role Play**: If you have a study partner, practice a role-play scenario. For example, one person could be a job applicant and the other the interviewer.

#### Self-Evaluation
- Reflect on your learning progress. Identify areas where you feel confident and areas where you need more practice.
- Set goals for continued learning. Consider how you can integrate German practice into your daily routine.

#### Homework for Day 7:
1. **Comprehensive Exercise**: Write a short essay or detailed dialogue that incorporates elements from each day's lesson. This could include introducing yourself, discussing your work and hobbies, expressing your opinions, negotiating a situation, and talking about future plans.
2. **Reflection**: Write a few sentences in German about your experience learning German this week. What did you find most challenging? What are you most proud of?
